# Title: Python Implementation of IEEE CEC 2013 Benchmark for Metaheuristic Algorithms


This repository offers a Python implementation of the IEEE CEC 2013 benchmark, originally defined by the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence. This benchmark is essential for testing the performance of metaheuristic algorithms specifically designed for continuous search spaces, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE). While previous implementations exist in C++, MATLAB, and R, this Python version caters to the growing popularity of Python among data scientists.

This project is a valuable resource for researchers and developers looking to evaluate and compare the efficiency of various metaheuristic algorithms in Python.
